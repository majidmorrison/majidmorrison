I am a product manager with a data-driven mindset and a get-it-done attitude. I've studied MBA in strategy and experienced leading a wide range of software products from logistics, social networks, and #finance applications and multi-dimensional marketplace platforms to AI-powered SaaS products. I am familiar with #agile project management and have worked with #Scrum and #Kanban methods. I'm interested in DeFi business and forcasting business strategy in products.
